Definitions from RFC 9110

100 Continue:  Client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.
101 Switching Protocols: Response to Upgrade request, indicates the protocol the server is switching to.
102 Processing: Server has received and processing the request.
103 Early Hints: Intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

200 OK: Request succeeded. GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body
				HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.
				PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.
				TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

201 Created: The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. Typically sent after POST or PUT.
202 Accepted: Request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is intented for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.
203 Non-Authoritative Information: This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly same as is available from the origin server. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource.
204 No Content: There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. 
205 Reset Content: Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.
206 Partial Content: This response code is used when the Range header is sent from te client to request only part of resource.
207 Multi-Status: Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.
208 Already Reported: used inside a response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.
226 IM Used: The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

300 Multiple Choices: The request has more than one possible response. HTML links to the possibilities are recommended so the user can pick.
301 Moved Permanently: The URL requested resource has been changed permanently. The URL is given in the response. 
302 Found: This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily.
303 See Other: The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request.
304 Not Modified: This is used for caching purposes. It tells that the response has not been modified , so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response.
305 Use Proxy: Defined in a previous version of the HTP specification to indicatei that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy. Deprecated due to security concern regarding in-band configuration of a proxy.
306 unused: No longer used, it is just reserved.
307 Temporary Redirect: The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method what was used in the prior request. has same semantics the 302 Found. User agent must not change the HTTP method used, if POST was used in the first request a POST must be used in the second request.
308 Permanent redirect: Resource is now permanently located at another URI specified by the location. This has the same semantics as the 301 Moved Permanently. User agent must not change the HTTP method. If a POST was used a POST must be used in the second request.
